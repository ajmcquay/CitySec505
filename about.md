We are a a local cybersecurity community in the /r/citysec vein. Everyone is welcome whether you work in the field or not. This is a social group, so while we may meet (virtually for now) there will be no slide decks or sales pitches. Reach out [via email](mailto:citysec505@protonmail.com) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YunuV5Z) if you'd like to get involved.
